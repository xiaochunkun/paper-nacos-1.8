### Link/paste of stack trace

    You can also simply just use code formatting in markdown!

___We need all of the stack trace! Do not cut off parts of it.___

### Plugin list:
___A list of your plugins___

### Actions to reproduce (if known):
___This may include a build schematic, a video, or detailed instructions to help reconstruct the issue___

### Paper build number:
___This can be found by running `/version` on your server. `latest` is not a proper version number; we require the output of `/version` so we can properly track down the issue.___
