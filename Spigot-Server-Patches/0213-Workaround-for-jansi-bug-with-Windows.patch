Subject: [PATCH] Workaround for jansi bug with Windows

When jansi attempts to extract its natives, by default it tries to extract a specific version
using the loading class's implementation version. Normally this works completely fine
however when on Windows certain characters such as - and : can trigger special behaviour.

Furthermore this behaviour only occurs in specific combinations due to the parsing done by jansi.
For example test-test works fine, but test-test-test does not! In order to avoid this all together but
still keep our versions the same as they were, we set the override property to the essentially garbage version
Paper. This version is only used when extracting the libraries to their temp folder.
