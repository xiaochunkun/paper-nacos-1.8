Subject: [PATCH] use CB BlockState implementations for captured blocks

When modifying the world, CB will store a copy of the affected
blocks in order to restore their state in the case that the event
is cancelled. This change only modifies the collection of blocks
in the world by normal means, e.g. not during tree population,
as the potentially marginal overheads would serve no advantage.

CB was using a CraftBlockState for all blocks, which causes issues
should any block that uses information beyond a data ID would suffer
from missing information, e.g. Skulls.

By using CBs CraftBlock#getState(), we will maintain a proper copy of
the blockstate that will be valid for restoration, as opposed to dropping
information on restoration when the event is cancelled.
