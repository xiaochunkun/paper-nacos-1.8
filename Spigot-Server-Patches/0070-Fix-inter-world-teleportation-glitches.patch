Subject: [PATCH] Fix inter-world teleportation glitches

People are able to abuse the way Bukkit handles teleportation across worlds since it provides a built in teleportation safety check.

To abuse the safety check, players are required to get into a location deemed unsafe by Bukkit e.g. be within a chest or door block. While they are in this block, they accept a teleport request from a player within a different world. Once the player teleports, Minecraft will recursively search upwards for a safe location, this could eventually land within a player's skybase.

Example setup to perform the glitch: http://puu.sh/ng3PC/cf072dcbdb.png
The wanted destination was on top of the emerald block however the player ended on top of the diamond block. This only is the case if the player is teleporting between worlds.
