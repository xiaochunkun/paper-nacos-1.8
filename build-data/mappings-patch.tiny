# SpecialSource2 automatically maps methods to the name of synthetic methods that point to it in an attempt to
# normalize method names with what is expected by the super class. This is _extremely_ stupid and flawed however
# because synthetic methods by definition have different descriptors than the base method, which means method
# signature clashes become possible, which is what happens here.
#
# LootEntryAbstract$Serializer has a synthetic method pointing to the base serialize() method with the following descriptor:
#
#    (JsonObject,Object,JsonSerializationContext)V  <-- ProGuard names this method `a`
#
# and this synthetic method points to another method with the specialized descriptor:
#
#    (JsonObject,LootEntryAbstract,JsonSerializationContext)V  <-- ProGuard names this method `b`
#
# SpecialSource2 automatically maps the second method name to the name of the first method, in this case `a`.
#
# LootEntryAbstract$Serializer also has another method with the same descriptor as serialize(), which Spigot calls
# serializeCustom(). Of course ProGuard strips the names and since this method is the first time it's seen this
# descriptor, it renamed that method also to `a`.
#
# This is allowed because the synthetic method for serialize() has a different descriptor, using Object as the second
# parameter. This breaks when SpecialSource2 does it's "magic" of course. This patch manually fixes this case by adding
# both correct mappings
