Subject: [PATCH] revert serverside behavior of keepalives

This patch intends to bump up the time that a client has to reply to the
server back to 30 seconds as per pre 1.12.2, which allowed clients
more than enough time to reply potentially allowing them to be less
tempermental due to lag spikes on the network thread, e.g. that caused
by plugins that are interacting with netty.

We also add a system property to allow people to tweak how long the server
will wait for a reply. There is a compromise here between lower and higher
values, lower values will mean that dead connections can be closed sooner,
whereas higher values will make this less sensitive to issues such as spikes
from networking or during connections flood of chunk packets on slower clients,
 at the cost of dead connections being kept open for longer.
