Subject: [PATCH] Ability to apply mending to XP API

This allows plugins that give players the ability to apply the experience
points to the Item Mending formula, which will repair an item instead
of giving the player experience points.

Both an API To standalone mend, and apply mending logic to .giveExp has been added.
